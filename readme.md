# UnboXt Taco Shop.  Build a Taco Ordering API!  Yum!

## What We Are Looking For

  1. Knowledge of Ruby on Rails.
  2. Familiarity with Javascript.
  2. Can work with technologies (i.e. Angular) that you may not have seen before.
  3. Can work independently and troubleshoot issues with **minimal requirements and guidance**.

## Requirements

#### Step 1: Build a Ruby on Rails application that serves the provided Angular App (see /index.html)

  When you visit `http://localhost:3000/` you should see the Angular app!

#### Step 2: Build a JSON API into the app you made in Step 1 that responds to the following endpoints:

  1. `GET /tacos` - Returns a list of all tacos in the database
  2. `POST /tacos` - Creates a taco with the given parameters
  3. `DELETE /tacos/:id` - Removes the taco with this ID from the database
  4. Add RSpec tests for the controller and model.

#### Step 3: Get the page looking ```as close as possible``` to the design shown in the file ```mockup.png```
  1. This is obviously not a good design, but this is a test to see if you can take a high fidelity mockup and make the app your working on look like said mockup.
  2. the design should match at 1080px only, don't worry about other breakpoints

#### Step 4: Upload your completed solution to a public [Github](https://www.heroku.com/) repository so we can review.

#### Step 5: Host the working solution on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and send the Heroku App URL to us for review.

## Bonus Features:

  1.  Add Validations to the Taco model.
  2.  Make the page mobile responsive down to 425px

## Known Issues
  * The HTML file will not work if you load it in your browser as a file (e.g. file://).
